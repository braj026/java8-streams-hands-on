 # Intermediate vs Terminal Operations

Intermediate operations (e.g., map(), filter(), sorted()) return a new stream. They're lazy, meaning they don't execute until a terminal operation is called.

Terminal operations (e.g., collect(), forEach(), count()) trigger the stream pipeline and produce a result or side-effect.

# map(), filter(), flatMap()
map() â€” transforms each element (e.g., String to uppercase).

filter() â€” removes elements based on a condition (e.g., keep only even numbers).

flatMap() â€” flattens nested structures like List<List<String>> into a single stream.

# In Java 8 and up, there are several collectors that make working with the Stream API more efficient, such as collect(), groupingBy(), and partitioningBy().  Here's how each one works:

collect(): A terminal operation that converts a stream into a List, Set, Map, etc.

groupingBy(): Groups elements based on a classifier function (for instance, employees grouped by department).

partitioningBy(): Splits data into two groups based on a predicate (such as True/False).

# IntSummaryStatistics
Java 8 provides built-in summary collectors like summarizingInt(), summarizingDouble(), etc.

These return IntSummaryStatistics or DoubleSummaryStatistics containing:

count, sum, min, max, average

# Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe
Fail-Fast (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) throws ConcurrentModificationException if modified during iteration.

Fail-Safe (e.g., CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap) avoids exceptions by working on a copy of the data.

Important when dealing with concurrency or modifying data during iteration.
